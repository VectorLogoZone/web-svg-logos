# Web SVG Logos

[![release](https://github.com/VectorLogoZone/web-svg-logos/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VectorLogoZone/web-svg-logos/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

This repo has code to index various logo websites for [LogoSearch](https://logosear.ch/).

## Organization

Site-specific code is in [`sites`](sites/)

Index files are in [`dist`](dist/).  Ideally, these would not be checked in, but I don't want to rebuild every index for each release.
